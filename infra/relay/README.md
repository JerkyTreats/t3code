# T3 Connect Relay

> [!NOTE]
> Sign in to T3 Connect from the app under Settings > Connections.

The relay is the hosted control plane for T3 Connect. It helps clients discover and connect to
remote environments, manages the cloud-side records needed for those connections, and delivers
optional mobile notifications and Live Activities.

The relay is intentionally not in the hot path for normal T3 Code traffic. After a client connects,
regular API and WebSocket traffic goes directly between that client and the selected environment.
See the [T3 Connect architecture note](../../docs/internals/t3-connect.md) for the larger system
design.

## Responsibilities

The relay currently owns:

- Linking T3 Code environments to a cloud account.
- Provisioning and tracking managed environment endpoints.
- Issuing short-lived credentials used to connect clients to linked environments.
- Listing linked environments and registered mobile devices for an account.
- Registering mobile notification preferences and APNs or FCM tokens.
- Receiving published agent activity and delivering notifications or Live Activity updates.
- Persisting relay state and exposing relay-specific traces for diagnostics.

The environment server and relay have separate credentials and trust boundaries. Read
[Environment Authentication Profile](../../docs/internals/environment-auth.md) before changing token,
credential, or authorization behavior.

## Code Map

- [`alchemy.run.ts`](./alchemy.run.ts) defines the deployed Alchemy stack.
- [`src/worker.ts`](./src/worker.ts) wires Cloudflare bindings, runtime layers, queues, and HTTP APIs.
- [`src/http/Api.ts`](./src/http/Api.ts) contains the relay HTTP handlers and authentication
  boundaries.
- [`src/environments`](./src/environments) contains environment linking, credentials, endpoint
  provisioning, and connection flows.
- [`src/agentActivity`](./src/agentActivity) contains mobile device registration, activity state,
  APNs and FCM delivery, and queue processing.
- [`src/auth`](./src/auth) contains relay token and DPoP proof handling.
- [`src/persistence/schema.ts`](./src/persistence/schema.ts) defines persisted relay state. Keep
  schema and migration changes together.

Shared request and response schemas live in
[`packages/contracts/src/relay.ts`](../../packages/contracts/src/relay.ts). Shared client-side relay
calls live in
[`packages/client-runtime/src/relay/managedRelay.ts`](../../packages/client-runtime/src/relay/managedRelay.ts).

## Working Locally

Install dependencies from the repository root, then run relay-focused checks from this directory:

```sh
vp install
cd infra/relay
vp test run
vp run typecheck
```

To run a smaller test set while iterating:

```sh
vp test run src/environments/EnvironmentLinker.test.ts
```

Before considering a change complete, run the repository-wide checks from the root:

```sh
vp check
vp run typecheck
```

Backend changes should include tests. Prefer testing the real business logic with external
dependencies represented at their boundary rather than mocking internal behavior.

## Deployment

The relay deploys with the Alchemy CLI. `vp run --filter t3code-relay deploy` invokes `alchemy deploy`
in this directory:

```sh
vp run --filter t3code-relay deploy
```

The stack provisions the Cloudflare Worker and queues, managed endpoint resources, database
connectivity, and relay tracing resources. Copy [`infra/relay/.env.example`](./.env.example) to
`infra/relay/.env` and fill in the deployment-specific values before deploying. Alchemy loads that
file from the relay directory. Runtime secrets include Clerk, APNs, and optional FCM credentials. Set
`APNS_ENABLED=false` for an Android-only development deployment without Apple credentials. Production adopts
the configured API and tunnel DNS zones as retained Cloudflare resources. Personal stages reference
the production-owned zones.

The `prod` Alchemy stage owns the retained PlanetScale database and is the shared hosted relay for
stable and nightly clients. Every other stage references that database and provisions an isolated
PlanetScale branch and runtime role for local development, so deploy `prod` before creating
developer stages:

```sh
vp run --filter t3code-relay deploy -- --stage prod
vp run --filter t3code-relay deploy -- --env-file .env.local
```

Alchemy defaults personal deployments to the `dev_$USER` stage. Relay custom domains apply the same
DNS-safe sanitization as Alchemy physical resource names, so `prod` uses
`relay.<RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME>` and `dev_example` uses
`relay-dev-example.<RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME>`. Managed environment endpoints are provisioned below
`RELAY_TUNNEL_ZONE_NAME`, which may be a different Cloudflare zone. Production tunnel hostnames use
`prod-<digest>.<RELAY_TUNNEL_ZONE_NAME>`; personal stages use
`<stage>-<digest>.<RELAY_TUNNEL_ZONE_NAME>`. `RELAY_DOMAIN` remains available as an explicit API
domain override.

The stack's `PublishClientConfig` action ([`src/clientConfig.ts`](./src/clientConfig.ts)) writes the
deployed relay URL and tracing configuration into the repository-root `.env`, so subsequent source
builds point at the relay that was just deployed without copying values manually. It runs only when
one of those outputs changed, and `T3CODE_RELAY_CLIENT_CONFIG_ENV` redirects it to another file.

### Fork deployment boundary

This fork does not ship automatic relay deployment or upstream release workflows. The Alchemy CLI remains available for a separately authorized deployment against explicitly configured resources. Local upstream reconciliation does not authorize any relay publication or provisioning.

Operator credentials belong in the selected deployment environment. Do not infer credentials, stages or destinations from the upstream repository's CI configuration.

See:

- [T3 Connect setup](../../docs/operations/connect-setup.md) for Clerk keys, JWT templates, and sign-up restrictions.
- [Relay Observability](../../docs/operations/relay-observability.md) for deployment tracing and diagnostics.
- [T3 Connect architecture](../../docs/internals/t3-connect.md) for environment linking and trust boundaries.
